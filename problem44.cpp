// Problem - Utopian Tree :
// The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
// Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after
// growth cycles?
// For example, if the number of growth cycles is n = 5,the calculations are as follows:
// Period  Height
// 0          1
// 1          2
// 2          3
// 3          6
// 4          7
// 5          14
// Input - t(testcases) , next t lines have n(cycles)
// Output - Height after n cycles for each n.
